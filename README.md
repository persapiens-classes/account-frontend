# Account

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

By default, the localhost:8080 backend is used. If you want to use other backends (codespace or production), try:

```bash
ng serve --configuration=codespace
```

If you are running a devcontainer inside Linux, you should run the project with the following options:

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200
```

If you are running a devcontainer inside Windows, you should run the project with the following options:

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200 --poll 2000
```


## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
